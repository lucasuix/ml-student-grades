# Grade Prediction w/ Machine Learning

## This repository contains a python virtual environment with the dependecies needed already installed

If for any reason, the python environment doesn't work, heres how to set up your own:

Open the terminal and type:

`$ python -m venv path/to/your/virtual/environment`

or

`$ python -m venv .`

If you're already in the directory you want to start the virtual environment.

Last, activate the virtual environment, using:

`$ source bin/activate`


Next we wanna install the depencies we gonna be using for this project.

`$ pip install scikit-learn`

`$ pip install pandas`
